Author: Michael Payton
Project: Rumination
Date: August 2025
Notes: Currently a draft ready for overview and further development.
Changes/Additions: must add questionnaires, must add consent form, likely 
                   needs to load parameters from .csv file. 

Edit Notes (2025-08-31):
- Implemented Versioning constant and per-row logging.
- Implemented Participant metadata (ID/session/timestamp) captured via prompts and added to all rows.
- Implemented File naming to include participant ID and ISO timestamp.
- Implemented Data schema completeness for dig rows (block_index, trial_index, pre_balance, post_balance, cumulative_scan_cost).
- Removed leading spaces from PTQ preamble and items 14 and 15 to eliminate invisible indentation. No wording changed.
- Added CSS fallback to center horizontal multi-choice options when no <ul> wrapper is present. Non-destructive and scoped to jspsych survey classes.
- Set survey layout to vertical for Q's by adding horizontal:false at the set level. Presentation only. Data schema unchanged.
